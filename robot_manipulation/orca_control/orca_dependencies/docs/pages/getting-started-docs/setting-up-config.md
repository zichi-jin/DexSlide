# Setting Up Config

Learn how to configure your ORCA Hand system settings. The primary configuration for the ORCA Hand is managed through the `config.yaml` file located in the model-specific directory (e.g., `orca_core/models/orcahand_v1_right/config.yaml`).

This file defines parameters crucial for the hand's operation, including communication settings, motor and joint mappings, movement ranges, and calibration procedures.

!!! Warning
    Be careful when editing this file, incorrect settings can cause unexpected behavior and make debugging more difficult.

## `config.yaml` Structure Overview

### 1. General Settings

```yaml
version: 0.2.0
baudrate: 3000000
port: /dev/ttyUSB0
max_current: 400
type: right
control_mode: current_based_position
```

**What should be changed?**

You should change the `port` to match your system (Linux or macOS). Change `type` to right or left depending on the hand assembly you have. `max_current` is set to a value found to be sufficient; you can adjust it depending on the needs of your tasks. The `baudrate` or `control_mode` should not be changed based on the current implementation in the repo. If you decide to change them you have to adapt the code accordingly.

### 2. Motor and Joint Id's

```yaml
motor_ids: [1, 2, 3, ..., 17]
joint_ids: [thumb_mcp, thumb_abd, ..., wrist]
```

**What should be changed?**

If you ID'ed the servos as per our recommendation you should change nothing here.

---

### 3. Joint to Motor Mapping and Inversion

```yaml
joint_to_motor_map:
  thumb_mcp: -4
  thumb_abd: -3
  ...
  wrist: 17
```

**What should be changed?**

This section defines which motor (by ID) controls each joint and how the sign of the motor ID affects its rotation direction.

* The number is the **motor ID**.
* The **sign** is determined by direction of rotation when flexing a joint.

#### Hand-Specific Guidelines

Flexion decides the sign of an servo ID. 

  * If **flexion** moves the servo **CCW** then a **no sign** should be included to the motor ID. 

  * If **flexion** moves the servo **CW** then a **negative sign** should be included to the motor ID. 

**Right hand assembly:** Most joints flexions lead to **CW** rotation so mostly negative signs are found.

**Left hand assembly:** Most joints flexions lead to **CCW** rotation so mostly none/positive signs are found.

If tendon routing is done properly, all joints should have the same sign, except for `index_abd`, `middle_abd` and `pinky_abd` joints. 

> **Note:** For abduction joints, flexion refers to movement **away from the thumb** and for the thumb flexion is **towards the fingers**.

For example:

```yaml
joint_to_motor_map:
  thumb_mcp: -4   # thumb_mcp flexion moves the motor with ID 4 CW
  index_abd: 14   # index_abd flexion moves the motor with ID 14 CCW
```

---

### 4. Joint Range of Motion (ROM)

```yaml
joint_roms:
  thumb_mcp: [-50, 50]
  ...
  wrist: [-50, 30]
```

**What should be changed?**

Unless you have modified the design, you should not change the values.

---

### 5. Neutral Position

```yaml
neutral_position:
  thumb_mcp: -13
  ...
  wrist: 0
```

**What should be changed?**

You can adjust this section if you want the hand to return to a different default pose.

---

### 6. Calibration Parameters

```yaml
calibration_current: 350
calibration_step_size: 0.1
calibration_step_period: 0.001
calibration_num_stable: 10
calibration_threshold: 0.01
```

**What should be changed?**

These parameters should generally not be changed unless you have experience tuning the calibration behavior for a specific hardware modification.

---

### 7. Calibration Sequence

```yaml
calibration_sequence:
    - step: 1
      joints:
        thumb_mcp: flex
    - step: 2
      joints:
        thumb_mcp: extend
    - step: 3
      joints:
        thumb_abd: flex
    ...
```

**What should be changed?**

If you want to specify the sequence or calibrate only specific joints you can adapt the sequence. If you are unsure, leave this section as is. An incomplete or incorrect sequence may lead to errors when executing commands later.
