class OrcaJointPositions:
    """Immutable, typed container for ORCA hand joint positions.

    Stores a mapping from joint name to joint position value. The class
    is frozen so instances can be safely shared across threads without copying.

    A set of default joint names can be registered once per process via
    :meth:`register_joint_names`; subsequent construction helpers use this
    ordering when none is supplied explicitly.

    Attributes:
        data: Mapping from joint name to position.

    Example:
        >>> # Create a new joint position object from a dictionary of joint positions
        >>> pos = OrcaJointPositions({"index_mcp": 0.5, "thumb_pip": 1.2})  # set keys arbitrarily
        >>> pos.as_list(["index_mcp", "thumb_pip"])
        [0.5, 1.2]
        >>> # You can also pass in an array of joint positions using specific joint names
        >>> pos = OrcaJointPositions.from_ndarray([0.5, 1.2], joint_ids=["thumb_pip", "index_mcp"])
        >>> pos.as_dict()
        {'thumb_pip': 0.5, 'index_mcp': 1.2}
        >>> # Register default joint ordering for your model
        >>> OrcaJointPositions.register_joint_names(["index_mcp", "thumb_pip"])
        >>> # You can now pass in an array of joint positions without specifying the joint ids
        >>> pos = OrcaJointPositions.from_ndarray([0.5, 1.2])
