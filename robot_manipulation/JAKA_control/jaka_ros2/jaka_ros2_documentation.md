# Introduction

## 1.1. ROS 2 Overview

- **ROS (Robot Operating System)** is a collection of open-source software libraries and tools that provide a flexible framework for developing and running robot applications.  
- **ROS 2** is the successor to ROS 1. It introduces improvements in performance, security, and real-time support, making it suitable for both research and industrial applications.  
- ROS 2 organizes code into **packages**, which are built together in a **workspace** using `colcon`. Each package may contain one or more **nodes** that communicate via **topics, services, or actions**.  
- The **JAKA ROS 2 package** primarily uses:  
  - **Topics** to send robot state data.  
  - **Actions** to handle long-running tasks (e.g., motion execution).  
  - **Services** for quick commands (e.g., enabling the robot).  

## 1.2. Purpose and Scope

### Purpose  
This document provides guidelines for installing and configuring the **JAKA ROS 2 package**, along with step-by-step tutorials for both **simulation** and **real robot operation**.  
It is intended for developers familiar with basic **ROS 2 concepts** who want to integrate JAKA robots into their applications.  

### Scope  

#### JAKA Robot Models  
The current release of the **JAKA ROS 2 package** supports all officially available JAKA 6-DOF cobot models, including the `JAKA A series`, `JAKA C series`, `JAKA Pro series`, `JAKA S series`, `JAKA Zu series`, and `JAKA MiniCobo`.  
All configuration files, drivers, and tutorials in this manual are designed for these models.  

#### Software Features Within Scope:
- **MoveIt Integration**: Motion planning and execution, including collision checking, kinematics, and trajectory generation.  
- **RViz Visualization and Simulation**:  
  - Real-time visualization of robot models, joint states, and planned trajectories.  
  - Although RViz is primarily a visualization tool, the package provides a basic **simulation-like environment** to preview planned motions and interact with the robot’s states. 
- **Gazebo Simulation Environment:** Full dynamic simulation of robots, including physics interactions and real-world dynamics. Gazebo is ideal for testing control algorithms and the dynamic response of the robot in a realistic simulated environment. 
- **Control Driver Interface**: A ROS 2 driver node for sending commands to the robot’s controller and receiving feedback on its state.  


## 1.3. JAKA ROS2 Package Structure

The two flowcharts below illustrate the package structure for **JAKA ROS1** and **JAKA ROS2** packages, respectively.

In transitioning from ROS 1 (Catkin) to ROS 2 (Colcon), the layout of the JAKA robot packages remains mostly the same, but the build and installation process has changed.  
Below is an overview of the key differences and why they matter.

### 1.3.1 Comparison with ROS 1

- **ROS 1 (Catkin)**:
  - `build/`: Holds CMake’s intermediate compilation files.
  - `devel/`: Contains development-linked binaries, scripts, and other runtime resources.
  - `install/`: Often used for optional final installation outputs (less commonly used during normal development).

- **ROS 2 (Colcon)**:
  - `build/`: Still contains intermediate build artifacts.
  - `install/`: Now serves as the main directory for runtime files—replacing the functionality of `devel/`.
  - `log/`: Stores build logs and debugging information.

### 1.3.2 Why the Change?

- **Clarity & Modularity**: By separating build artifacts (`build/`) from final install artifacts (`install/`), ROS 2 makes it clearer what’s used at runtime vs. what’s needed for building.
  
- **Package Isolation**: Colcon enforces a more consistent workspace structure, reducing dependency conflicts and easing deployment to other systems.

## 1.4. Supported Platforms and System Requirements

The **JAKA ROS 2 package** is designed to provide seamless integration of JAKA collaborative robots within the ROS 2 ecosystem.  
To ensure stability and performance, this package has been tested and verified on specific software and hardware configurations, which are outlined below.

### 1.4.1 Supported ROS 2 and Gazebo Distributions

- Currently, this package is officially tested and supported on **Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)** with **ROS 2 jazzy**. While this package is primarily tested on **ROS 2 jazzy**, it may be possible to build and run it on **ROS 2 Galactic** or **Iron**, but compatibility is not guaranteed.
- This package is designed to work with **Gazebo Ignition Fortress**, which is the recommended simulation environment for **ROS 2 jazzy** and provides stable, high-performance physics-based simulations. The package has also been tested on **Gazebo Classic**, and while functional, it is not recommended due to being outdated for ROS 2 jazzy. Users may experience instability and performance issues.
- Future releases of this package may extend support for newer ROS 2 and Gazebo distributions as they become officially available.

### 1.4.2 Supported Controller Versions

To ensure optimal performance and compatibility with the **JAKA ROS 2 package**, we have established specific requirements for the controller firmware. The minimal supported controller version is **1.7.1.46**, which provides the essential functionalities required for basic operations. For improved stability, enhanced features, and seamless integration with both ROS 2 and MoveIt 2, the recommended controller version is **1.7.2.16**. We advise users to upgrade to the recommended version, as it has been thoroughly tested and is currently the latest available version.

### 1.4.3 Minimum Hardware Requirements

The following table displays the recommended minimum system requirements based on **ROS 2** and **MoveIt 2**'s typical resource consumption, as well as industry best practices for running robotic applications efficiently.

| **Component**         | **Recommended Minimum Requirement**              | **Notes**                                                                                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Processor (CPU)**| 64-bit Intel i5 / i7 (or equivalent AMD)      | Multi-core CPU recommended for running motion planning and real-time sensor processing.     |
| **RAM**           | 8 GB RAM minimum (16 GB recommended)          | MoveIt 2 motion planning and RViz visualization require significant memory.                 |
| **Storage**       | 20 GB free space (SSD preferred)              | Faster storage improves launch times and data processing.                                   |
| **GPU (Optional)**| NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support                 | Not required for basic functionality but beneficial for advanced perception applications (e.g., AI-based vision processing, real-time SLAM). |

# 1.5. ROS2 Basic Commands

In this section, we introduce fundamental ROS 2 commands that are commonly used when working with the **JAKA ROS 2 package**. These commands allow users to build, run, and debug ROS 2 nodes, manage topics, services, parameters, and launch files.  
Unlike ROS 1, ROS 2 introduces a more modular and flexible system, using **Colcon** for building workspaces, **DDS (Data Distribution Service)** for communication, and replacing commands like `rostopic`, `rosnode`, and `rosservice` with the `ros2` CLI tool.

The table below provides a summary of essential ROS 2 commands and their functions.

  - `ros-jazzy-ros2-control`: core ROS 2 control infrastructure.
  - `ros-jazzy-controller-manager`: lifecycle and management of controllers
  - `ros-jazzy-ros2-controllers`: a set of common controller implementations (e.g., joint state broadcaster).

  Below are steps to install these dependencies via apt. 

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y \
      ros-jazzy-ros2-control \
      ros-jazzy-controller-manager \
      ros-jazzy-ros2-controllers
    ```

**4) MoveIt 2 Visualization & Control Interfaces**  
- Install **visualization plugins** for RViz, **MoveIt control interface integration**, and **visual tools** for debugging:  
  - `ros-jazzy-moveit-ros-visualization`: RViz plugins and visualization layers for MoveIt 2 (planning scene display, etc.).
  - `ros-jazzy-moveit-ros-control-interface`: integration between MoveIt 2 and ROS 2 control for executing planned trajectories on controllers.
  - `ros-jazzy-moveit-visual-tools`: helper libraries for publishing markers, interactive markers, and other runtime visual debugging aids.

  Below are steps to install these dependencies via apt. 

    ```bash
    sudo apt update

      ros-jazzy-moveit-ros-visualization \
      ros-jazzy-moveit-ros-control-interface \
      ros-jazzy-moveit-visual-tools
    ```
**5) MoveIt 2 Planners (OMPL)**
- The default **sampling-based planners** in MoveIt rely on **OMPL**. Install:  

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y ros-jazzy-moveit-planners-ompl
    ```

#### 2.1.3.2 Gazebo Fortress Installation

-	This package supports **Gazebo Fortress** for simulation with ROS 2 jazzy. Ensure that ROS 2 integration with Gazebo Fortress is properly set up by installing the ros-gz bridge package.
-	To install Gazebo Fortress, follow the official Ignition Gazebo installation guide: [Gazebo Fortress Binary Installation](https://gazebosim.org/docs/fortress/install_ubuntu/).

**1) Install some necessary tools:**  
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lsb-release gnupg
```  

**2) Install Ignition Fortress:**  
```bash
sudo curl https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.gpg --output /usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/pkgs-osrf-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list > /dev/null

### Steps to Switch SDK Versions:

**1) Download the Desired SDK Package**  
Visit JAKA's official website to download the SDK version you wish to use: [JAKA Downloads](https://www.jaka.com/download).

**2) Replace the `libjakaAPI.so` File**  
a) Navigate to the `lib` directory within both the `jaka_driver` and `jaka_planner` packages in your installed JAKA ROS 2 workspace.  
b) Replace the `libjakaAPI.so` file with the version provided in the downloaded SDK.  
c) For **version 2.1.14**, the `libjakaAPI.so` file can be found in the following directory within the unzipped SDK folder: `20241018100240A001/Linux/c&c++/x86_64-linux-gnu/shared`

**3) Replace the Header Files**  
a) Navigate to the following `include` directories in your installed JAKA ROS 2 workspace:  
- `jaka_driver/include/jaka_driver`  
- `jaka_planner/include/jaka_planner`  

b) Replace the following header files with their counterparts from the downloaded SDK:  
- `JAKAZuRobot.h`  
- `jkerr.h`  
- `jktypes.h`  

c) For **version 2.1.14**, these files can be found in the following directory within the unzipped SDK folder: `20241018100240A001/Linux/c&c++/inc_of_c++`

**4. No Need to Modify `conversion.h`**  
The `conversion.h` file in `jaka_driver/include/jaka_driver` is not part of the JAKA SDK and does not require any changes. You can leave this file as it is.

By following these steps, you will successfully switch to a different SDK version (such as 2.1.14) in your JAKA ROS 2 workspace, ensuring compatibility with the selected SDK version.

# Getting Started (Tutorials)

## 4.1.	Basic Tutorial: Controlling JAKA Robot with jaka_driver Package

The `jaka_driver` package is a control driver that enables communication with the JAKA robot via ROS 2 services and topics.  
This section provides example service calls and executable runs that request various services or SDK functions to send basic control commands to the robot and check its status.

### 4.1.1	Starting the JAKA ROS 2 Driver

Before executing robot commands, the `jaka_driver` node must be started. Use the following command to launch the driver and establish a connection with the robot:
```bash
ros2 launch jaka_driver robot_start.launch.py ip:=<robot_ip>
```
> **Note:** Replace `<robot_ip>` with the actual IP address of your robot. This parameter is required for successful communication.

<figure id="figure-4-1">
  <img src="images/Figure 4-1: Launch JAKA Driver Server.png" alt="Launch JAKA Driver Serve">
  <figcaption>
    <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-1: Launch JAKA Driver Server Command Output</strong></p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### 4.1.2	Example Service Commands

The following examples demonstrate how to send control commands to JAKA robots using the `jaka_driver` package.

**1)	Executing Joint Motion**  
To move the robot in the joint coordinate system, call the `/jaka_driver/joint_move` service with the appropriate parameters as follows:
```bash
ros2 service call /jaka_driver/joint_move jaka_msgs/srv/Move "{
  pose: [0, 1.57, -1.57, 1.57, 1.57, 0],
  has_ref: false,
  ref_joint: [0],
  mvvelo: 0.5,
  mvacc: 0.5,
  mvtime: 0.0,
  mvradii: 0.0,
  coord_mode: 0,
  index: 0
}"
```  

> **Note:** The joint motion interface is blocking by default. To use a non-blocking interface, modify the corresponding parameter in **jaka_driver.cpp**.

  <figure id="figure-4-2">
    <img src="images/Figure 4-2: Joint Motion Service.png" alt="Joint Motion Service">

    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-3: Joint Motion Service Execution</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>  

**2) Executing Linear Motion**  
To command the robot to move in a linear motion in the user coordinate system, use the /`jaka_driver/linear_move` service with the required parameters as demonstrated below:
```bash
ros2 service call /jaka_driver/linear_move jaka_msgs/srv/Move "{
  pose: [111.126, 282.111, 271.55, 3.142, 0, -0.698],
  has_ref: false,
  ref_joint: [0],
  mvvelo: 100,
  mvacc: 100,
  mvtime: 0.0,
  mvradii: 0.0,
  coord_mode: 0,
  index: 0
}"
```

> **Important:** The pose parameters in this example are for reference only. Ensure that the pose values are within the robot's workspace and do not result in singularities or exceed motion limits.

      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-5: Linear Motion Service Execution</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

**3)	Computing Forward Kinematics**  
To calculate the forward kinematics of the robot given joint positions, call the `/jaka_driver/get_fk` service with the required input parameters as shown below:
```bash
ros2 service call /jaka_driver/get_fk jaka_msgs/srv/GetFK "{
joint: [0, 1.57, -1.57, 1.57, 1.57, 0]
}"
```

    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-6: Forward Kinematics Service Command Output</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

**4)	Computing Inverse Kinematics**  
To determine the joint configuration required to achieve a specific Cartesian pose, use the `/jaka_driver/get_ik` service with the appropriate input parameters as follows:
```bash
ros2 service call /jaka_driver/get_ik jaka_msgs/srv/GetIK "{
ref_joint: [0, 1.57, -1.57, 1.57, 1.57, 0],
cartesian_pose: [130.7, 116, 291, 3.13, 0, -1.5707]
}"
```

    </figcaption>
  </figure>

### 4.1.3	Running Executables in the JAKA Driver Package

In addition to the `jaka_driver` node, the JAKA driver package includes other executables for basic testing of certain services and SDK functions available in the `jaka_driver` package. These executables allow you to interact with the robot in different ways, test specific services, and verify robot functionality. 
Below are the necessary steps and examples for running these executables.

**1) Running the Servo J Executable**  
The `servoj_demo` executable is used to test the robot's servo mode by enabling it and commanding the robot to move incrementally to specific joint positions. This executable tests the `/jaka_driver/servo_move_enable` and `/jaka_driver/servo_j` services, which control the robot's joint motion in servo mode.  
To run the executable, first ensure that the `jaka_driver` node is running. Use the following command to launch the driver and establish a connection to the robot:
```bash
ros2 launch jaka_driver robot_start.launch.py ip:=<robot_ip>
```
> **Note:** Replace `<robot_ip>` with the actual IP address of your robot.  

Then, launch the executable with the following command:
```bash
ros2 run jaka_driver servoj_demo
```
This will enable the servo mode and start executing joint movements. The servo motion will move the robot incrementally to the specified joint positions, demonstrating its basic control functionality.

  <figure id="figure-4-8">
    <img src="images/Figure 4-8: Servoj Demo Executable.png" alt="Servoj Demo Executable">
    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-8: Servoj Demo Executable Command Output</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure id="figure-4-9">
    <img src="images/Figure 4-9: ServoJ Demo Execution.png" alt="ServoJ Demo Execution">
    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-9: ServoJ Demo Execution</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

**2) Running the Client Executable**  
The `client` executable is a service client node designed to test the `/jaka_driver/linear_move` service. This executable sends a request to the `linear_move` service to move the robot to a specific Cartesian position in its workspace.  
To use the client, ensure that the `jaka_driver` node is running first. Use the following command to launch the driver and establish a connection to the robot:
```bash
ros2 launch jaka_driver robot_start.launch.py ip:=<robot_ip>
```

> **Note:** Replace `<robot_ip>` with the actual IP address of your robot.

Then, in another terminal, execute the following command:
```bash
ros2 run jaka_driver client <x_position>, <y_position>, <z_position>, <rx>, <ry>, <rz>
```

> **Note:** Replace `<x_position>`, `<y_position>`, `<z_position>`, `<rx>`, `<ry>`, `<rz>` with the desired Cartesian coordinates and orientation for the robot's target pose. Ensure these values are within the robot’s workspace and avoid singularities.  

**Example:**
```bash
ros2 run jaka_driver client 111.126, 282.111, 271.55, 3.142, 0, -0.698
```

  <figure id="figure-4-10">
    <img src="images/Figure 4-10: Client Executable.png" alt="Client Executable">
    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-10: Client Executable Command Output</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure id="figure-4-11">

    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-11: Client Execution</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

**3) Running the SDK Test Executable**  
The `sdk_test` executable connects to the robot at the specified IP address and verifies communication with the robot by enabling it and retrieving the current joint positions. This serves as a basic verification step to ensure that the robot is powered on and the connection is functional.   
The executable accesses the robot's current joint positions using the SDK and displays the retrieved values. Unlike the previous two executables, `sdk_test` does not require the `jaka_driver` node to be running, as it automatically powers on the robot and enables it.  
To run the SDK test, simply execute the following command:
```bash
ros2 run jaka_driver sdk_test --ros-args -p ip:=<robot_ip>
```

> **Note:** Replace `<robot_ip>` with the actual IP address of your robot.

## 4.2. MoveIt 2 Tutorial: Planning and Execution

MoveIt 2 is a powerful motion planning framework that enables trajectory planning and execution for robotic arms. While the updated `jaka_ros2` package now supports **Gazebo simulation** for real-time trajectory execution, it still provides an **RViz-based simulation mode** for cases where Gazebo cannot be used due to system limitations, hardware constraints, or other requirements.

To enable this RViz simulation mode, modifications are required in the `launches.py` file that comes with the default MoveIt 2 package installation. The `jaka_ros2` package provides an adjusted version of this file, which users can replace in their system to achieve the desired functionality. 

The key modification made to `launches.py` is the addition of the `use_rviz_sim` parameter. When set to `true`, this parameter enables simulation mode. By default, `use_rviz_sim` is set to `false`.

### 4.2.1 Setting Up MoveIt 2 with JAKA Robot (RViz Simulation)

1) Ensure that **MoveIt 2** and the `jaka_ros2` package are properly installed.  
2) Replace the default `launches.py` file with the modified version provided in the `jaka_ros2` package ([launches.py](./launches.py)). You can use the `find` command to locate `launches.py` in the MoveIt 2 installation directory as shown below.

  <figure id="figure-4-13">
    <img src="images/Figure 4-13: Locate launches.py.png" alt="Locate launches.py">
    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-13: Locate launches.py Command Output</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

3) Launch MoveIt 2 in RViz simulation mode using the following command:  
```bash
ros2 launch jaka_<robot_model>_moveit_config demo.launch.py use_rviz_sim:=true
```

> **Note:** Replace `<robot_model>` with the appropriate JAKA robot model name (e.g., `zu3`, `s5`, `a12`, `minicobo`, etc.).

  <figure id="figure-4-14">
    <img src="images/Figure 4-14: Launch Demo Moveit Config in Simulation Mode.png" alt="Launch Demo Moveit Config in Simulation Mode ">
    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-14: Launch Demo Moveit Config in Simulation Mode Command Output</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

### 4.2.2 Planning and Executing a Trajectory

1) Once RViz is launched, the robot model will be displayed in the environment.  
2) Move the **interactive marker** (represented as a ball at the robot’s end-effector) to the desired target position, or select a target pose from the **"Goal state"** of the RViz interface.  
3) Click **"Plan & Execute"** to generate and visualize the robot's trajectory.

  <figure id="figure-4-15">
    <img src="images/Figure 4-15: RViz Simulation Mode Execution.png" alt="RViz Simulation Mode Execution">
    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-15: RViz Simulation Mode Execution</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

This approach allows users to perform trajectory planning and execution within the RViz environment without a physical JAKA robot or 3D simulation software tool, ensuring flexibility and broader accessibility in various development environments.

## 4.3 Gazebo Simulation Tutorial: Real-Time Trajectory Execution in Gazebo

Gazebo is a powerful simulation environment that provides realistic physics and visualizations for robotics applications. In this section, we demonstrate how to use Gazebo with the `jaka_ros2` package to simulate real-time trajectory planning and execution in a simulation environment.

Similar to the RViz simulation described in [Section 4.2](#42-moveit-2-tutorial-planning-and-execution), this tutorial uses customized launch files (i.e., a modified `launches.py`). The key modification made to [launches.py](./launches.py) is the addition of functions used to independently launch Gazebo for model visualization and to launch an integrated Gazebo simulation environment with RViz.

### 4.3.1 Setting Up Gazebo Simulation with JAKA ROS2

**1) Ensure required packages are installed:**  
   Before proceeding, make sure that **Gazebo Ignition Fortress** and the `jaka_ros2` package are properly installed.

**2) Update customized launch files:**  
   Replace the default `launches.py` file with the customized version provided by the `jaka_ros2` package (details in [Section 4.2.1](#421-setting-up-moveit-2-with-jaka-robot-rviz-simulation)).

**3) Launch Gazebo for Model Visualization Only:**  
   To visualize the JAKA robot model in Gazebo, run the following command using the customized `gazebo.launch.py` file:  
   ```bash
   ros2 launch jaka_<robot_model>_moveit_config gazebo.launch.py
   ```  

> **Note:** Replace `<robot_model>` with the appropriate JAKA robot model name (e.g., zu3, s5, a12, minicobo, etc.).

This command starts Gazebo Fortress with the default world (an empty world containing only a ground plane and a light source) and spawns the robot based on the published robot description. The robot will be visible in the Gazebo GUI for inspection.

  <figure id="figure-4-16">
    <img src="images/Figure 4-16: Launch Gazebo Simulation Independently.png" alt="Independent Gazebo simulation Execution" width="1200">
    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-16: Independent Gazebo Simulation Execution</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

**4) Launch Gazebo with RViz for Trajectory Planning and Execution:**  
   To enable real-time trajectory planning and execution in a simulation environment, run the `demo_gazebo.launch.py` file that integrates Gazebo with RViz:  
   ```bash
   ros2 launch jaka_<robot_model>_moveit_config demo_gazebo.launch.py
   ```  

> **Note:** Replace `<robot_model>` with the appropriate JAKA robot model name (e.g., zu3, s5, a12, minicobo, etc.).

### 4.3.2	Demonstrating Trajectory Execution in Gazebo

**1) Launch the demo environment:**  
   After following the steps in [Section 4.3.1](#431-setting-up-gazebo-simulation-with-jaka-ros2), the robot model will appear in both **Gazebo** and **RViz** environments.

**2) Set the target pose:**  
   - Move the **interactive marker** at the robot’s end-effector in RViz to the desired position.  
   - Alternatively, select a **Goal State** from the RViz interface.

**3) Plan and execute the trajectory:**  
   - In RViz, click **"Plan & Execute"** to generate and visualize the robot's trajectory.  
   - The robot in **Gazebo** should now execute the planned trajectory in real-time.

  <figure id="figure-4-17">
    <img src="images/Figure 4-17: RViz for Demo Gazebo Simulation Execution.png" alt="RViz for Demo Gazebo Simulation Execution">
    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-17: RViz for Demo Gazebo Simulation Execution</strong></p>

    <figcaption>
      <p align="center"><strong>Figure 4-18: Demo Gazebo Simulation with RViz Execution</strong></p>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

This process allows users to test motion planning and execution in gazebo simulation environment without requiring a physical robot.

## 4.4. Real Robot Tutorial: Controlling Real JAKA Robot

### 4.4.1 Safety Precautions & Robot Setup

Before controlling a real JAKA robot, it is essential to ensure proper setup and safety measures to prevent collisions, equipment damage, or potential hazards. This section outlines key safety considerations, payload configuration, and operational best practices.

**1) Environment & Operational Safety**
- **Work Area Clearance:** Ensure the robot's workspace is free of obstacles and personnel during operation. Define and enforce restricted zones if necessary.
- **Power & Network Stability:** Use a stable power supply and verify the network connection between the control PC and the robot to prevent unexpected interruptions.
- **Emergency Stop Access:** Familiarize yourself with the robot's emergency stop button and verify that it is functional before operation.

**2) Safe Operating Zone and Motion Limits Configuration**
- **Collision Avoidance:** Configure safety zone boundaries in the JAKA app to limit robot movement within a designated safe area.
- **Monitor Joint Limits:** Ensure that planned motions do not exceed the robot’s joint range limits to prevent overextension.

**3) Payload Configuration**  
When attaching external tools such as grippers or other end-effectors, the payload settings must be updated to ensure accurate motion control and avoid excessive joint stress.
- **Set Payload Parameters:** Adjust the robot’s payload configuration based on the attached tool’s weight and center of mass using `/jaka_driver/set_payload` service or on the JAKA app.
- **Verify Torque Limits:** Excessive payloads can lead to joint overloading. Ensure the robot’s maximum payload limits are not exceeded.
- **Tool Center Point (TCP) Calibration:** Define an accurate TCP to improve motion precision and prevent tool misalignment or collision.

**4) Motion Planning & Collision Checking**
- **Simulate Trajectories in RViz:** Before executing a movement on the real robot, first plan and verify it in RViz to check for potential collisions, singularity errors, or out-of-range motions.
- **Set Safe Motion Parameters:** Define appropriate velocity and acceleration limits for safe execution using MoveIt 2 configuration files available for each robot model package or on the RViz interface.

### 4.4.2 Launching the `jaka_planner` Package

This section describes how to start the MoveIt 2 server and RViz to plan and execute trajectories with a real JAKA robot.

#### Precondition
Before launching the `jaka_planner` MoveIt 2 server, ensure that the `jaka_driver` server is **not running**, as MoveIt 2 and the JAKA ROS driver cannot operate simultaneously. If `jaka_driver` is active, stop it before proceeding.

#### Starting the MoveIt 2 Server
To launch the MoveIt 2 server, open a terminal and execute the following command, replacing `<robot_ip>` with the actual IP address of the robot and `<robot_model>` with the corresponding JAKA robot model you’re working with (e.g., `zu3`, `s5`, `a12`, `minicobo`, etc.):
```bash
ros2 launch jaka_planner moveit_server.launch.py ip:=<robot_ip> model:=<robot_model>
```

#### Starting the MoveIt 2 Client in Rviz

In a new terminal, start the MoveIt 2 RViz interface using the following command replacing `<robot_model>` with the appropriate JAKA robot model name you used above:
```bash
ros2 launch jaka_<robot_model>_moveit_config demo.launch.py
```

Once launched, the RViz interface will open, displaying the robot model. The visualization should reflect the current real-world position and orientation of the physical robot.

> **Note:** The default value of **use_rviz_sim** parameter is **false**, so when using Moveit 2 and Rviz with a real robot, there is no need to explicitly specify `use_rviz_sim:=false` unless you want to ensure clarity.

### 4.4.3 Planning & Executing Trajectory in RViz with Real Robot

Once the MoveIt 2 server and RViz interface are running, you can plan and execute trajectories directly from RViz. In RViz, you can plan and execute motions for the JAKA robot using **interactive markers**.  
When defining a target position, there are two execution methods:

**1) Plan & Execute (Not Recommended for Initial Testing)**
- Drag the **interactive marker** at the end-effector to the desired location, or select a target pose from the **"Goal state"** of the RViz interface.
- Clicking **"Plan & Execute"** will generate a trajectory and immediately send it to the robot for execution.
- This approach executes the motion in real time without prior visualization, which may lead to unexpected movements if the target position is unreachable or causes a collision.
- Use this method **only when you are certain** that the trajectory to the target position is safe.

**2) Recommended Approach – Plan First, Then Execute**
- Drag the **interactive marker** at the end-effector to the desired location, or select a target pose from the **"Goal state"** of the RViz interface.
- Click **"Plan"** to generate and visualize the trajectory in RViz before executing it.
- If the trajectory is **safe and feasible**, click **"Execute"** to send the motion command to the robot.

## 4.5. Running moveit_test for Basic Motion Testing

The `moveit_test` executable provides a simple way for users to test MoveIt 2's motion planning and execution on a JAKA robot. It serves as an initial verification step for newcomers to see how the **JAKA ROS 2 package** interacts with and controls JAKA robots. This test can be performed using a **real robot**, in **RViz simulation mode**, or with **Gazebo simulation**.

#### Purpose of `moveit_test`
- Provides an easy starting point for users to verify motion control with MoveIt 2.
- Helps test communication between **JAKA ROS 2 package** and JAKA robots.
- Allows users to validate the robot’s motion planning in joint space using a predefined sequence of joint space movements.

### 4.5.1	Running moveit_test with Real Robot
To perform the test with a real robot, ensure the MoveIt server is running before executing `moveit_test`.  
Run the following commands in separate terminals:
```bash
ros2 launch jaka_planner moveit_server.launch.py ip:=<robot_ip> model:=<robot_model>
ros2 launch jaka_<robot_model>_moveit_config demo.launch.py
ros2 run jaka_planner moveit_test --ros-args -p model:=<robot_model>
```

> **Note:**  
> - Replace `<robot_ip>` with the actual IP address of the robot.
> - Replace `<robot_model>` with the corresponding JAKA robot model.  
> - For moveit_test, the default robot model is set to `zu3` in the code. If using a different model, specify it in the startup command (`-p model:=<robot_model>`).

### 4.5.2	Running moveit_test in RViz Simulation Mode
To perform the test in RViz simulation mode without a physical robot or 3D simulation software tools (like gazebo), omit the MoveIt server launch and start the RViz demo with the `use_rviz_sim` parameter set to `true`.  
Run the following commands in separate terminals:
```bash
ros2 launch jaka_<robot_model>_moveit_config demo.launch.py use_rviz_sim:=true
ros2 run jaka_planner moveit_test --ros-args -p model:=<robot_model>
```  

> **Note:** Replace `<robot_model>` with the corresponding JAKA robot model.

### 4.5.3	Running moveit_test with Gazebo Simulation
To perform the test with gazebo simulation without a physical JAKA robot, omit the MoveIt server launch and launch gazebo or demo gazebo with RViz.  

**1) Running moveit_test on Independent Gazebo Simulation:**  
Run the following commands in separate terminals:  
```bash
ros2 launch jaka_<robot_model>_moveit_config gazebo.launch.py
ros2 run jaka_planner moveit_test --ros-args -p model:=<robot_model>
```  

> **Note:** Replace `<robot_model>` with the corresponding JAKA robot model.
